## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was a great project to implement what I already know of React, Sass, and Emmet.

### Continued development

I believe that it styles can be simplify by using more flexiable units, and being flexiable withe website not looking like a pixel perfect copy of the design.
